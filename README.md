# Announceman bot data for cycling in Tbilisi
This repository contains location data for [Announceman bot](https://github.com/lunrox/announceman)
(routes and starting points).

You can fork this repo and adjust for other locations\activities.

Bot will use names of the routes/starting points you set in json files, 
so keep them short for better looks.

Only Komoot, Strava and RideWithGPS routes supported,
for starting points you can use whatever maps you like.

Route preview urls are optional. I used RideWithGPS previews because they look good.
